    line1: 'CUPL was born in the basement of the CU rec center in 2016. A group of competitive lifters created this community with a passion for powerlifting, and a recognition of the need for school support. Competitive powerlifting can be a challenging sport to enter, with financial obstacles in addition to limited access to knowledgeable communities. Over the years, CUPL has grown to nearly 100 members, including over 15 women. We pride ourselves on welcoming everybody to our community because we truly believe the sport should be accessible to all. Resources like school funding, our Gym No 5 sponsorship, and our head coach Weston Hirschauer allow us to spread the joy of competitive powerlifting to our ever growing club.',
