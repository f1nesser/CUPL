        quote: '“I’ve been working with Weston for a little more than a year and we’ve made drastic improvements since. In the first 4 months he took my total up around 70 pounds and improved my form so much. I’m thankful for how much effort and thought he puts in, how easy he makes meet day, and for the high standard that he holds me to. I’m excited to continue working with Weston and hopefully we’ll win a national championship next year.”',
